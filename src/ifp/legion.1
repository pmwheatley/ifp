.TH LEGION 1 "Interactive Fiction Plugins" "IFP" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
.\"
legion \- multi-format Interactive Fiction interpreter
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\"
.B legion
[-glk glk_library] [glk_library_options] [file | URL]
.PP
.\"
.\"
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\"
.PP
.B legion
interprets Interactive Fiction games, using a system of interpreter
plugins to decode the games held in input file of various formats.  The
current release of \fBlegion\fP can handle the following game formats:
.PP
Z-machine, TADS, HUGO, Alan, Glulx, AGT, AdvSys, Level9 SNA, Magnetic
Scrolls, Adrift, Quest, and Blorb
.PP
It can also directly handle compressed, gzipped, and bzipped data files,
zip, tar, and cpio archives, and Internet URLs that reference files of
the above types.  On completing a game, \fBlegion\fP will attempt to
clean up the display library, then prompt for another game file or URL
to play.
.PP
.B legion
loads its Glk library on starting, and can work with any of the Glk
libraries supplied by IFP.  The \fI-glk\fP option requests a specific Glk
library, otherwise \fBlegion\fP will use the value set by IFP_GLK_LIBRARIES
or by the IFP configuration file.
.PP
.B legion
takes an optional single input argument.  This is a path to a game file
to run, a path to a compressed data file, or archive, containing a valid
game file, or an Internet URL that references a game file or archive.  If
the argument is omitted, \fBlegion\fP will print out full details of all
of the interpreter plugins it finds on the IF_PLUGIN_PATH.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

IF_PLUGIN_PATH is a colon-separated string that defines the path to search
for Interactive Fiction and Glk plugins.  If there is no defined value, the
default is "/usr/local/lib/ifp:/usr/lib/ifp".
.PP
.\"
IFP_GLK_LIBRARIES is a comma-separated string that indicates which Glk
libraries to search for on starting.  Glk libraries can be named either
partially or fully, for example "xglk" or "glkterm-0.7.8", and are loaded
from IF_PLUGIN_PATH.  Alternatively, an entry can be a full path to a
loadable Glk library.  The default is "xglk" where DISPLAY is set,
"glkterm" where TERM is set, or "cheapglk" otherwise.

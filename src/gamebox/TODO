Updated support for full and final versions of IFMES and iFiction (if and
when available).  Add support for more iFiction and IFMES RDF properties.

Either verify that all RDF+XML is correctly parsed by Gamebox, or use a
real RDF parser.  Verify parsing of Ifiction and INI metadata files.

Verify ISO 8601 date display handling.

Update catalog.xml and catalog.ini for accurate game lengths.

Consider making ignoring "The ...", "An ...", or "A ..." when sorting by name
more internationalized.  Consider more lexical, less ASCII-based sorting.

See if Gamebox can determine if it's nesting, so that Close can be replaced
by Back in nested sessions.

Improved hyperlink-less interface.  Perhaps a cursor (moving arrow) alongside
games, with an action key to run them?  Improved hyperlink interface for very
long catalogs.

Display game and other icons in graphical Glk libraries.

Show, for each game, the IFP plugin it will run on.

Create a dialog to allow metadata updates, and iFiction and IFMES RDF+XML
editing.  Improved tools for handling XML in general.  Something similar for
INI?

Improved browsing.  Perhaps pointing Gamebox at a directory could have it
automatically catalog all games found in that directory (like local file://
browsing in Mozilla, maybe?).  Extend to http: and ftp:?

Find a better solution to the sigaction() hack in urlhandler.c.

Understand why calling glk_exit() from Gamebox causes problems later on.

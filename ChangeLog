	AGiliTy interpreters.
	* Made the Pkunzip plugin more lenient when unable to uncompress

	* Remote URL data is now downloaded asynchronously, using SIGIO.
	* Added a URL cache, so that playing the same URL multiple times
	requires only one download.
	* Fixed a fault in the functions that reset Glk; this fault caused
	xlegion to crash after playing some games (notably Glulx).
	* Fixed an omission where plugins failed to unload their plugin lists;
	this fault caused xlegion to crash on occasion after playing two or
	more compressed games of different game file types.
	* IFP now automatically detects loading of plugins that may in turn
	load other plugins, and takes steps to ensure that the shared objects
	in each get their own private execution space.
	* Added full Blorb support.  IFP can now handle Blorb files containing
	either Glulx or Z-machine games.

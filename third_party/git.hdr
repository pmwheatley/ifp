# Glulx data files have a nice, easy-to-spot format, that isn't likely to
# conflict with other game files.  They begin with either "Glul".  This plugin
# can also handle GLUL exectuables in Blorb files.

engine_description=\
"Git is an interpreter for the Glulx virtual machine.  Its main goal in life
 is to be fast. It is about five times faster than Glulxe, and about twice as
 fast as Frotz (using the same Inform source compiled for the Z-machine).\n"

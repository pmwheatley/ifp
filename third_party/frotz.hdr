# The Z-machine game file format, as it stands, doesn't really lend itself to
# recognition - see the file /usr/share/misc/magic, or equivalent, for
# evidence of this.  However, for us, what matters most is differentiating
# Z-machine games from other IF games, not from all other files.  Here we're
# looking for the first byte be 0x01 to 0x08 (the version number), and the
# second be 0x00-0x0F (Z-machine uses only low nibble "flags", so far, anyway).
# Moreover, we need to make a small gap in this recognition space for Alan,
# which uses the first two bytes as its game version - currently 2.7 or 2.8.

# It turn out that we can just about get away with this, since the only games
# known to use Z-machine version 2 are older Zork I and Zork II, and for these
# particular two games, "flags" is known to be 0x00.  So until, Alan goes to
# version 3, we're okay.

# Like Z-machine, Alan2 games use the first byte as the version number.  They
# use the second byte as the minor version number, and the Alan2 2.8
# interpreter can handle 2.8 games, and 2.7 in compatibility mode.  There is
# a potential clash with older (version 2) Z-machine games.  Z-machine uses
# the second file byte as "flags", which could conceivably be 7 or 8.
# However, and luckily, the only games known to use Z-machine version 2 are
# Zork I and II, and the "flags" byte for these games is 0x00.  So, a small
# hole in the Z-machine recognition patterns is necessary to let Alan2 in.

# AdvSys files have a marker string "ADVSYS" at bytes 2-7, and a 16-bit
# version number at bytes 8 and 9.  AdvSys 1.2 refuses the file if the
# version number is not 101 or 102.

# There's a minor complication with this, however.  AdvSys stores its game
# data in "complemented" format, transforming each byte from the input file 
# with new = ~(old + 30).  So, "ADVSYS" actually appears as A0 9D 8B 8E 88 8E,
# and 101 or 102 as 7B E1 or 7C E1.

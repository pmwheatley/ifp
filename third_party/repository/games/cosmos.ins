
Like most text adventures the syntax in CosmoServe is straightforward. EXAMINE
everything mentioned in the room descriptions. You can interact with characters
by TALKING TO [ someone ] or by ASKING [ someone ] ABOUT [ something ], or by
OFFERING, SHOWING or GIVING [ something ] TO [ someone ]. Type ? for a list of
function key macros.

Unlike other games, much of CosmoServe will be played in a simulated computer
environment where 'normal' text commands will not be relevant. If you get stuck
during the game, F10 will usually bring some direction. As always, SAVE your
game so you can RESTORE it if something goes wrong, but remember, the clock is
ticking while you're playing CosmoServe! You will probably have to RESTART the
game at some point to play it more strategically.

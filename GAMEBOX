Gamebox is a game catalog plugin for IFP.  It accepts IFMES game catalogs
in either RDF+XML or INI format, or iFiction XML catalogs, and offers the games
described in them in menu form.  IFP is a plugin scheme for Interactive Fiction
virtual machines.


Gamebox resides in the file

    gamebox-0.0.4.so

To use Gamebox, put the file somewhere in your IF_PLUGIN_PATH, or set
IF_PLUGIN_PATH so that it picks up the file.  Gamebox will automatically
accept, on behalf of IFP, RDF+XML files that contain IFMES catalogs, XML
files that contain iFiction catalogs, and INI files that begin with the special
";GAMEBOX_0.4" identifier line.


There are example IFMES and iFiction catalogs for all of IFP's standard example
games, in the files

    catalog.ifmes
    catalog.ifiction
    catalog.ini

To run Gamebox with IFP's example games, then, use

    ifpe catalog.ifmes, or
    ifpe catalog.ifiction, or
    ifpe catalog.ini

Not all metadata in these catalogs is accurate.  See commentary in the files
for more.  Although no examples use http: URLs, it is just as easy to use
those in catalogs as local files.  For example, in IFMES RDF+XML:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <RDF:RDF xmlns:BAF="http://wurb.com/if/"
             xmlns:IF="http://purl.org/int-fiction/metadata/1.1/"
             xmlns:RDF="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
      <BAF:game
        RDF:about="http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/curses.z5"
        IF:title="Curses"
        IF:desc="It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist
    map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it
    has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It
    looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these
    lofts..."
        IF:author="Graham Nelson"
        IF:releaseDate="1995-10-24"
        IF:genre="Attic crawl"
        IF:version="16">
      </BAF:game>
    </RDF:RDF>

or, using the much simpler IFMES INI format:

    ;GAMEBOX_0.4
    [curses.z5]
    about=http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/zcode/curses.z5
    title=Curses
    desc=It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That tourist
    map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter, even if it
    has been five years since your last trip. And it's your own fault. It
    looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person to tidy up these
    lofts...
    author=Graham Nelson
    releaseDate=1995-10-24
    genre=Attic crawl
    version=16

or, finally, in ("sparse") iFiction format:

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <ifindex version="1.0"
             xmlns="http://babel.ifarchive.org/protocol/iFiction/">
      <story>
        <bibliographic>
          <title>Curses</title>
          <description>It's become a matter of pride now not to give up. That
          tourist map of Paris must be up here somewhere in all this clutter,
          even if it has been five years since your last trip. And it's your
          own fault. It looks as if your great-grandfather was the last person
          to tidy up these lofts...</description>
        <author>Graham Nelson</author>

    </RDF:RDF>

Should the IF Archive ever publish IFMES or iFiction catalogs, Gamebox should
be able to work inside IFP with something like (hypothetically):

    ifpe http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/catalog.xml


The full source code for Gamebox is included in this package.  To build
Gamebox from sources, type

    make all

on a system that has IFP and the IFP libraries installed on it.


At the time of writing, the IFMES standard is incomplete and fluid.  It's
very likely, then, that Gamebox does not fully or completely support all
IFMES.  In particular, Gamebox only knows about the current version of
IFMES, 1.1 draft "2 September 2005".

Gamebox uses IFMES RDF+XML data files as one of its catalog formats, and is
perhaps the first released application to try to use this format.  This
release of Gamebox uses a 'cut price' RDF parser, one that may not parse
all IFMES RDF+XML files correctly.  This RDF parser appears to work with all
known IFMES RDF+XML files currently available, but that doesn't mean it will
work with all, or even any, future files.  See the supplied catalog.xml file
for a little more on this topic.

RDF+XML files are hard to create by hand, so as an alternative data file
format, Gamebox will accept INI files.  Its INI file parser is reasonably
complete, but may not fully accept everything that a Windows INI file parser
might be happy with.  See the supplied catalog.ini file for more.

For RDF+XML data files, Gamebox will try to group games into categories
according to the RDF Seq or Bag specifications it finds.  There is currently
no way in INI files to express game categories, so this feature cannot be
used with INI data files.


The iFiction standard, as of 13th April 2006, is similarly incomplete and
fluid.  Gamebox's use of iFiction groups is limited, because the specification
itself does not offer anything other than the most basic group identification.

iFiction does not record a measure of a game's length, and holds publisher
information unevenly.  Game release information is held in system-specific
rather than common tags, so may not be available for all systems.  A game's
first published date may not necessarily be the date on which the build being
described was made; currently, iFiction records the release date explicitly
only for TADS games.

iFiction specifies downloads from "http://babel.ifarchive.org/download/"
followed by the game's IFID.  If you need to change this base URL you can do
so by setting the value of the GAMEBOX_BABEL_URL environment variable.


Gamebox works moderately well with Xglk, avoiding overrunning Xglk's display
buffer by paging large game lists (there are Xglk options to extend the buffer
size).  It also works with Glkterm and Cheapglk, though without hyperlinks it
has to drop down to numbered menu items, making it inconvenient to use.

It works with Gargoyle, though unfortunately the current release of Gargoyle
does not offer hyperlinks, leaving only numbered menus.  It also works with
Gtkglk; this Glk library does offer hyperlinks, but to activate them you
need to double-click, which sometimes leads to additional and unwanted text
selections.


Gamebox is beta software.  See the TODO file for a partial list of Gamebox's
shortcomings.

You can use catalog.py to create skeleton minimal IFMES and iFiction catalogs
for system directories containing IF game files.  Use 'catalog.py -h' for a
usage message, describing how to do this.
